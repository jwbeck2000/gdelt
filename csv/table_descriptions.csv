mentions,"The Mentions table is a new addition to GDELT 2.0 and records each mention of the events in the Event table, making it possible to track the trajectory and network structure of a story as it flows through the global media system. Each mention of an event receives its own entry in the Mentions table – thus an event which is mentioned in 100 articles will be listed 100 times in the Mentions table. Mentions are recorded irrespective of the date of the original event, meaning that a mention today of an event from a year ago will still be recorded, making it possible to trace discussion of “anniversary events” or historical events being recontextualized into present actions. If a news report mentions multiple events, each mention is recorded separately in this table. For translated documents, all measures below are based on its English translation."
mentions,"Several of the new measures recorded in the Mentions table make it possible to better filter events based on how confident GDELT was in its extraction of that event. When trying to understand news media spanning the entire globe, one finds that journalism is rife with ambiguities, assumed background knowledge, and complex linguistic structures. Not every event mention will take the form of “American President Barack Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday at a trade summit in Paris, France.” Instead, an event mention might more commonly appear as “Obama and Putin were in Paris yesterday for a trade summit. The two leaders met backstage where he discussed his policy on Ukraine.” To which of the two leader(s) do “he” and “his” refer? Is Obama discussing Obama’s policy on Ukraine, or is Obama discussing Putin’s policy on Ukraine, or is it Putin discussing Putin’s policy or perhaps Putin discussing Obama’s policy? While additional cues may be available in the surrounding text, ambiguous event mentions like this are exceptionally common across the world’s media. Similarly, it would be difficult indeed to maintain an exhaustive list of every single political figure in the entire world and thus context is often critical for disambiguating the geographic affiliation of an actor. Even in the case of more senior political leadership, a reference to “Renauld’s press conference this afternoon in Port-au-Prince” most likely refers to Lener Renauld, the Minister of Defense of Haiti, but this disambiguation still carries with it some degree of ambiguity. GDELT makes use of an array of natural language processing algorithms like coreference and deep parsing using whole-of-document context. While these enormously increase GDELT’s ability to understand and extract ambiguous and linguistically complex events, such extractions also come with a higher potential for error. Under GDELT 1.0, the NumMentions field as designed as a composite score of the absolute number of unique documents mentioning an event and the number of revisions to the text required by these various algorithms, up to six revision passes. Under GDELT 2.0, the Mentions table now separates these, with each record in the Mentions table recording an individual mention of an event in an article, while the new Confidence field"
mentions,"records GDELT’s confidence in its extraction of that event from that particular article. This field is a percent, ranging from 10 to 100% and indicates how aggressively GDELT had to perform tasks like coreference or grammatical restructuring to extract the event from that article. Sorting all mentions of an event by this field makes it possible to identify articles featuring the strongest and most unambiguous discussion of an event."
